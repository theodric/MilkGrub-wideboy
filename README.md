# 🥛 Milk Outside A Bag Of Milk Grub - **WIDEBOY** Edition

![screenshot](/screenshot.png)

This is a ~blatant ripoff~ fork of [gemakfy/MilkGrub](https://github.com/gemakfy/MilkGrub) which moves the menu text over a smidge and widens it so I can see my whole kernel name.

### 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theodric/MilkGrub-wideboy.git
sudo ./MilkGrub-wideboy/install.sh
```

### ❄ NixOS
Do not use NixOS. It is bad. You don't need it.
